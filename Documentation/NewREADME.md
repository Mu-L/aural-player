## Overview

Aural is an audio file player for macOS. If you loved Winamp on Windows, chances are you'll love Aural üòâ Made for those who still have a bunch of audio files sitting around, the main aims here are ease of use, being able to tinker with sound (if that's your thing), and customizability.

If you're a long-time user, you'll notice the many improvements in v4 - better aesthetics, enhanced usability, and new ways to browse, search, and organize your music collection. Note - while "preview" releases are available now, v4 is still in development and expected to come out in late 2024.

### Project philosophy

Aural doesn't aim to be perfect or to be the best player out there. This app is about fun, incorporating ideas from its community of users, and evolving and improving over time. It wouldn't have made it this far without all the amazing user feedback, feature requests, and bug reports üôè

## Standout features

### Extensive audio formats support

Thanks to the power of ffmpeg, you can throw almost any format at Aural and it will probably be able to play it! FLAC, Vorbis, Opus, APE, Musepack, and WMA are some of the many formats supported, in addition to all native (CoreAudio) formats.

### Sound tuning and monitoring

If you're an audiophile who needs each track to sound a certain way, you'll appreciate the built-in effects and AU plugin support which means limitless possibilities for tuning and monitoring. Aural can also remember your sound settings per track!

### Personalization

Make the app uniquely yours by trying its several fun theming options!

### Flexible UI footprint

With a modular UI and multiple app presentation modes, you can mold Aural to fit onto your desktop just the way you want.
