#  What's New in Version 4.0.0-preview11

## Metadata caching

Thanks to @focusonsight for suggesting this improvement!

Aural will now cache track metadata (including embedded cover art) for faster loading of tracks on subsequent app launches. 

This caching behavior will be enabled by default, but can be disabled, or the cache cleared, via the metadata preferences (Aural > Preferences > Metadata).
