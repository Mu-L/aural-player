## Overview

Aural is an audio file player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be easy-to-use and customizable ... a simple drag-drop-play player that can do a lot!

### Project philosophy & mission

Driven by love, and bounded by time and knowledge constraints ðŸ˜„, this project is about developing a fun and useful app for macOS users who have a bunch of audio files sitting around. Over the years, the app has absorbed countless amazing ideas from the community that uses and loves it. While improvement will always be a goal, the app does **NOT** aim to be "perfect" or "the best" or "better than" ... it just is.

## Key features

### Flexible UI
With Winamp-like modularity and multiple app presentation modes, you can lay out the app to suit your workspace, reduce it to a tiny widget, or tuck it away in the macOS menu bar.

### Personalization 
Personalize Aural Player with exactly the colors and fonts that define your creative tastes. Save and re-use your hand-tailored themes.

### Extensive audio formats support
By harnessing the power of FFmpeg, Aural Player supports a [wide variety of popular audio formats](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Features#audio-formats), in addition to all [macOS Core Audio formats](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX.html).

### Sound tuning and monitoring
With several built-in effects and support for Audio Unit (AU) plug-ins, sound tuning and monitoring possibilities are endless. Also check out the built-in visualizer ðŸ˜‰

### Usability
Command Aural in many ways - Handy keyboard shortcuts for common tasks (eg. EQ bands / time stretching), configurable media keys, swipe and scroll trackpad gestures + mouse function buttons for basic functions, Control Center integration ("remote control").

## What's new in v4
Version 4 of the app is bringing with it a lot of great improvements: (NOTE - some of these features are still being developed)

- A full-fledged library allowing you to browse and listen to your entire collection right from within Aural!
- A new waveform view.
- Replay Gain.
- CUE sheet support.
- Gapless playback.

## Roadmap

### Version 3 archived

Version 3 has been archived, and no further work will be done on it. The source code for it can be found in the new repository: [aural-player-archive](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player-archive)

All pending and newly filed issues (bugs or feature requests), if implemented, will be implemented in v4.

### V4 Preview releases

Preview builds are unstable pre-release builds containing incremental updates as v4 continues to be developed. They may contain significant bugs. Several preview builds have been put out and more are expected to come out before the milestone releases.

### V4 Milestone releases

As of Nov 11, 2024, there are 2 upcoming major milestones for Version 4:

<ins>Partial release</ins>: The partial release of v4 will contain all core + new functionality, except for the new Library and all related functionality. It will be stable and free from major bugs.

<ins>Full release</ins>: The full release of v4 will be the first official (and complete) release of v4.

There are no current date estimates for the milestone releases.

## How it works (under the hood)

Aural Player uses **AVFoundation's AVAudioEngine** framework (and some low-level **Core Audio**) for playback, effects, and visualization, and uses **FFmpeg** libraries to decode formats not native to macOS.

The UI is built on top of AppKit with views defined in XIBs (no SwiftUI).

The code is written entirely in Swift (approximately 100,000 lines of code).

Read more about it [here](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player/wiki/Developer-reference).

### Limitations

* Currently, Aural does not play online streams.
* Aural does not play protected content (for example, Apple's M4P or Audible's AAX). There are no plans to implement this.
