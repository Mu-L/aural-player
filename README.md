## Project archived - It's time to say goodbye!

I will no longer be actively working on this project, so it's time to say thank you and goodbye! This means no bug fixes, no new features, no new releases.

There is one final release that you will find under "Releases". Use it if you'd like to ... I make no claims about whether or not it will work for you.

Thank you for all the ideas, suggestions, and contributions!
