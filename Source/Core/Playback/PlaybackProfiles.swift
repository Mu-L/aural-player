/// A playback profile is an encapsulation of all playback settings for a particular track,

/// By capturing a playback profile, and mapping it to a track, the app can "remember"
/// playback settings on a per-track basis.
///
/// For example, if the user is listening to a lengthy audiobook and saves a playback
/// profile for the track and then exits the app ... when the user plays that audiobook again,
/// it will resume playing from the last playback position, so the user can continue
/// listening to it without having to remember the last playback position.
